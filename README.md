## Gameplay Description 🕹️

Sporet, the tenured gooling scientist, embarks on a goo-licious mission to explore the caves of planet Goopiter. Despite his clumsy reputation, Sporet's got a goo-donkulous secret weapon - his long arms are perfect for navigating the goo-filled rail system! 🚂

As Sporet, you'll grind and hang on the neon-lit rails, performing goo-tiful jumps to avoid spikes and gaps. But here's the goo-dy part: Sporet can only jump while grinding, so rail placement is goo-ly important! Falling or hitting spikes will disconnect Sporet from the rail, and he'll need to use his vertical goo-bility wisely. Riding underneath the rails charges Sporet's special "Goofling" ability, a goo-rific jump that lets him pass through spike-less rail sections with gooey grace! 😎

But beware! The screen only moves forward, and if Sporet slips too far to the left, he'll meet goo-stly left-screen spikes. Your goal? Guide Sporet through each level without becoming goo-paste on those spikes! 🌟

## Win/Lose Condition 🏆

- **Win:** Reach the goo-tastic end of the level.
- **Lose:** Get goo-terminated by screen spikes or plunge into the gooey abyss below.
